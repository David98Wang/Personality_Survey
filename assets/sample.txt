Sample Test

#first are the questions

#the first line is number of questions
#after that are the questions

#When a response is chosen, points are added to several categories called "types"
#types are represented by an integer, with the first one being "1"
#each choice can add points to multiple categories
#the format for is type followed by a space, then the number of points awarded
#if multiple response types are needed, then just add them all in one line, seperated by a space

#after questions are the results
#first line is the number of results (not necessarily the same as number of types)

#the program will display all results that have their criteria satisfied
#for every result, there can be multiple criteria. The result is only displayed if all of them are satisfied
#there are 3 types of criteria:
#	1. min/max criteria:
#		the result will only be displayed if the points for the specified type (category of response) is between 
#			the given bounds
#		format:
#			the first line is the type to check for
#			the second line contains 2 numbers, indicating the minimum and maximum acceptable point values inclusive
#	2. maximum:
#		the result will only be displayed if the specified type (category of response) is the maximum
#		format:
#			the first line is 0, indicating that this is a special criteria
#			the second line is the category to check for
#	3. comparison:
#		the result will only be displayed if the first type has fewer or equal points as the second type
#		format:
#			the first line is -1, indicating that this is a special criteria
#			the second line contains 2 integers, the types to compare
